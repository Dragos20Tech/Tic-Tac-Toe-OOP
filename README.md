# TicTacToe-OOP

I built this game to improve my OOP skills. I had help from my teacher during the implementation process of this game, but this time
I found it much easier to understand the relationship between classes because I had previous experience with the DiceGame project. Building the logic
of the game wasn't as difficult as I thought it would be after hours of trial and error.

## Play the game

I assume you've played this game at least once in your life, so I won't explain what you have to do to beat the computer. If not,
then you should play the game using my code and one of these links : https://www.online-python.com or https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/.
